1. Time-Based State Decay
Decrease hunger, energy, and mood at regular intervals (e.g., every minute).
If hunger or energy gets too low, decrease health.
If mood is low for a long time, decrease health or attention.
2. User Interactions
Let the user feed, play with, or let the pet rest to restore states.
Add simple mini-games or activities to boost mood or energy.
3. Pet Reactions
Show different animations or messages based on the pet‚Äôs current state (happy, sad, hungry, tired, sick).
If the pet is neglected for too long, it could "run away" or "get sick" (add consequences).
4. Reminders and Notifications
Remind the user to take care of the pet if states are low.
Use the chat or voice to notify the user.
5. Persistence
Save the pet‚Äôs state to a file so it persists between sessions.
When the app starts, load the last state and calculate how much time has passed to update the pet accordingly.
